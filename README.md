# Sticky Banner

`index.html` is pretty much just a duplicate of the instruction/test original html file. I used it to edit the tests a little bit as I make progress on the code. It also uses images that are able to download (I couldn't access - placeholdit.imgix.net - API).

Please disregard it if the original file is enough for your testing.
